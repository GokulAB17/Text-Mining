  Price is a little bit high but the quality and the product is good.Games : Csgo : 150 Avg fps at all high 1080p . If you lower you can reach 250+ ezy  Apex : 70 avg at all high 1080p  Gta V: 60 avg at all high 1080p  Valorent : 120 avg at all high 1080pCooling is very good max cpu goes 85'c  at constant 4 hour gaming.Screen should have been 144hz but its kind of oky and not oky because its very hard for a laptop to hit 144 fpsconstant in games . But while browsing you can feel the smoothness a little bit if you have a 144hz display.One thing i found weird was same laptop same price and spec is listed but has 144hz display.https://www.amazon.in/gp/product/B088FLNT3G/ref=ox_sc_saved_title_1?smid=A14CZOWI0VEHLG&psc=1Even asus rog g strix, hp omen 15, dell all 10 gen are listed on flipkart and amazon and have the same and more price  but i think nitro  is a better option . And plz dont compare this with tuf . Tuf has bad cooling and diplay nd ryzen 4000 series is only good for streaming and multi tasking . I dont think anyone would stream on a laptop. Intel i5 10 gen can also handle those task.Please dont give 1 star just because you havent used the laptop many people are doing that.

  Overall best laptop from acer..1. Processor intel core i5 10300h 10th gen.2. Graphics intel uhd+ Nvidia gtx 1650 ti.3.full ips display but 60hz only4. Rgb keyboard.5. NitrosenseThere is no any issue but display should be 144 hz.

  i5 10th gen +gtx 1650ti is more than enough for heavy tasks and 1080p gaming. The batterylife is also pretty decent. The nvme ssd is good too. Loved the 4 zone rgb keyboardNote - for 1st time boot you need to connect it to the charger to activate the battery otherwise laptop wont boot. 1st insert the charging pin into the charging port and push it hard until you hear a click ,  only then the battery indicator will glow and you can turn on the device. I struggled nearly for an hour to figure this out. First i thought that i got a defective product but actually the pin didnot give the click sound and laptop was not getting power from AC

  The refresh rate of the product should have clearly mentioned in the description as it a major thing to look in the laptop.You people didn't provide it in description i checked in Q&A and felt it was 144hz! But it is just 60 hz and it happened just bcoz you didn't provide the details in description

  Screen backlight bleeding problem occured twice when I bought this laptop , 1st time it got replaced and the replacement was the worst, it came with screen backlight bleeding and the coil whine sound. Never buy this laptop. Worst experience. Also never buy from .Appario Retail Private Ltd

  A perfect laptop packed with tons of features. It's boot time is very fast within 4 to 6 seconds. Acer has killed it this time. I had trouble during my first setup as it was not starting. When my plug of charger was removed and inserted again perfectly it started(Plz read the manuals for the correct position of the charger). Some of my views regarding this laptop:Pros:1 THE RGB lighting keyboard is amazing looks awesome and has many modes.2 Display is very crisp and the videos have amazing clarity.3 Temperature doesn't go beyond 65 degrees Celsius (when using normally and no game is played)4 The speakers sound like 3d sound and dts ultra enhanced sound is amazing.5 It has many features for gamers like the GeForce experience and the nitrosense which have many features in it.I will update it after experiencing moreCons:1 The refresh rate is 60Hz and I am missing the 144 Hz panel laptop.2 You can stream videos in HDR but you will not be able to watch videos in HDR.3 The speakers sound 3d but it is not much loud.4 Battery backup is less not as promised by Acer. In the normal usage the battery lasts for 5 hrs max5 Laptop looks overpriced and I think it should be within 65 to 70k but after buying you will feel satisfied for this price.I will update it when I experience it more.

  Just received package and after opening tried to start but it's was not starting even if power adaptor is connected. Instantly tried to replace wasn't allowing then had a conversation with Amazon service executive and they just did an assignment of technician that to almost week later date. I am not satisfied with the recent services and products delivered by Amazon.

  Im loving it, good specs for 63k, it even has 4 zone rgb, the screen is 60hz which is the only downside, haven't found any defects yet and i hope it stays that way, if your laptop doesn't turn on try pushing the charging pin harder because its a bit tight and it won't charge if not plugged in properly, though im confused why this 1650ti model cheaper than the 1650 model <U+0001F914>, is there a reason for that or is it some kind of mistake, any way im quite happy at least for now...

  Well, i got my laptop delivered yesterday and as a first impression it looks solid and sturdy to me.....no other laptop  with  such specifications is available at such price point so it's value for money........  There were so many negative reviews on this laptop.....i dunno why but this laptop is best in this price range (i got it at 61k)  I will give my detailed review after 3 months of usage

  I got these laptop in an amazing deal at Rs. 62990. Its steal deal at these price point.I received a fully genuine product with nice packaging. The delivery time was also good.The laptop offes i5 10th generation with 1650ti which is not available below 70000. Everything is perfect except screen refresh rate but i have no problem with it. Compromising refresh rate for 1650ti makes sense for me lol.Overall great deal.I will keep on editing review as i use it further.

   Awesome laptop and can handle any thing u throw at it...the only downside is it's 60hz screen and mediocre speakersGot it @65k in sale so great deal I may say....way better than most of the laptops in this price range.Got the laptop withing 18 hrs of ordering thanks to Amazon delivery.Tried photoshop, illustrator, simulations, gtav, pubg everything ran like a breeze.It has better build than Asus tuf I owned but miss the 144 hz display while playing games with high frame rate but most games won't give u that may so, ok

  Quality Laptop from acer. This might be a gaming laptop but can be used for coding, online classes , graphic designs, video editing(basic) etc. Fully loaded with features and RGB keyboard is an absolutely delight. For normal tasks Graphic card remains switched off ...so battery life is good. Fan control is also in our hand so it won't run meaninglessly when not required. Packaging was excellent. Acer knew about this laptop selling big time so had a huge stock ever since the festival sale started. I almost took a week to decide between Acer Nitro and Asus Tuf.  Although there wasn't much between them but finally chosed Acer for better build quality and better battery backup. Actually I had made my mind to go for Ryzen 4600H processor instead of Intel i5 10th Gen but Ryzen 4600H series wasn't much in stock and prices were marked bit too high. This laptop was always marked in the deal of the day and prices remained consistent. All negative ratings were basically given by people who didn't inserted the charger properly. Anybody who has budget around 65k...this Laptop is the best deal.

  Got it for <U+20B9>62,990 during the Diwali sale. Its great for gaming as well as coding. It has 3 storage slots and 2 Ram slots, so very modular. Display and sound is just above average, but the 1650Ti is what outshines this laptop.

  Great buy. A good gaming laptop to start with. So happy with the delivery and packaging. Using it since a week now, games run fine with the GeForce 1650Ti graphics. Battery Backup is as expected with 2-3 hrs of Gaming and 4-6 hrs of normal usage. Only thing which has to be configured is the sound which can be made sufficiently well via the DTS X Ultra app.

  Battery , thermal and display are the main highlights. It gave me battery back up of over 7+ hrs on doing coding and movie watch over Internet. Display can run 4k videos smoothly, i5 10th gen is fast, boot time is 10-15 secs, temperature stays around 50°c on doing moderate work.I was confused between Asus Tuf A15 and this but after using for 4 days I am happy with my decision. If your budget is around 60k, don't hesitate, go for this.

  I bought this on great Indian festival for 60K after bank offers. The laptop looks too much plastic but the quality of the display, keypad, and trackpad are great. I have tested COD WWII, it runs silky smooth, no logging or no heating issues. In power-saving mode, I got 6-7 hrs battery and while gaming I got around 1.5-2 hrs battery. So for so good. I  highly recommend this version (2020) go for it.

  I got this laptop for INR 61,740. I think, I got it for less price comparing other reviews. It is the best laptop around 60k. I like many features in this laptop which are already described in details. I don't like it's front camera. It is terrible. If you want to use  camera, you have to buy a web cam. I came to know that Acer Nitro 5 2020 model has some screen bleeding issues. So check after you buy it.

Moreover Display is a bad ass for this price range. acer nitro sense is a good software you can control performance ,fan speed , RGB lighting and Nvidia GeForce experience. Thermals are quite good<U+0001F525>.

Waiting for new replacement.FINAL REVIEW: No issues yet, I got a new piece this time. Screen bleed is there (every laptop gets it, don't worry). Got a good keyboard. Everything is A-okay for now. Don't jump in blindly. Buy during offers.

  I ordered it during great indian festival sale. might be i got a faulty unit becasue temps reach almost 95C after half an hour of gaming for CPU. Playes AC origins and crysis 3 ,for both of them temps reached 95C. AMbient temperature is aound 22C so dont expect this to happen.Esp chose this over ASUS Tuf a 15 due to thermals.

  Recently purchased this laptop for 63k, It is only 4th day of using this machine. The laptop looks awesome little bit heavier but not too much. Battery life is not too bad. I had a minor screen bleeding but it is IPS panel so little bit of bleeding is normal.I had a single hot or dead pixel at upper right side of screen although it has shrinken to a negligible size. Performance is great without lags, sound is lower than normal. But overall a good purchase.

Display, boot time, processingDislikes were battery sometimes, Sound average, camera (below avg)

  I got it for 63k at that price it's nice value for money. Most games run smooth on Max settings @60fps(60hz model), i just locked the GeForce at 60fps itself.Only Two Complaints after around 30days of use,1. Battery life at performance mode isn't good, you can't play a game without having it plugged in. In general use too you get around 1.5hrs without plug in.2. Recently CPU Temps have increased it touches 94° sometimes and being intel that throttles performance and so low fps.Other than this it's been a good buy for me.

  I bought during the laptop during the great indian sale( price was 63k), now its 66k I think. Its honestly a great deal if you are getting a laptop with 1650ti graphic card at that price(you would normally get one with 1650 only).Still I had my doubts about product quality since it was coming at such low price. But , luckily, it has been 2 weeks since I bought this one, and it has been great.Watch dogs 2 worked fine at 'ultra ' settings and hitman at high settings with a decent fps. I am not a battle royale kinda guy, so didn't test fortnite and all. I still can't guarantee you about the laptop you would get as you could see in the reviews that few are receiving faulty laptops.Will update,if any problems occur

   I really had a very bad experience with the product I recieved as it was defective I returned the product and recieved the new product which was defective again so I am really dissatisfied with the product I recieved.Performance : The Acer Nitro 5 is one of the best laptop present in the market at this price range. I has a very fast processor and has a very good display and it can be use for high performance. I took it for Video Editing purpose and it excels in it. If you are a gamer I will recommend you to go for it.Thank you

  Laptop is good but I feel some problem my battery drain in only 2 hours even in power saving mode and also not satisfied with display but it's ok. Second if you want full power then you have to plug in the charger otherwise it's work only on 2.6 gigahertz. Cooling was great just great. if your work is heavier than you 100% required and another 8 gigs Ram so If you don't think you don't have any laptop work then go for PC which give you more performance at same price. If if you're not really want a laptop portability then hundred percent go for PC which gives you more power with a bigger screen at a same price

  Go for it good laptop  i will totally recommend this good service and support by amazonSome games will lag a little bit but only for a few milliseconds touchpad quality not so good but fair .Biggest pro: Instant Startup time after shut downYou can surely can do multitaskRGB lighting in keyboard is not inside the keys may be you can get difficulty at night only for pro gamers and streamers.Screen bleeding issues are upto very small extent if you are not professional you will not even notice it.You can do programming and other tasks like attending online classes you can do it very easily and without any hassle.Virtual machines can be run very smoothly and efficiently.If you are a student in either school and college totally recommend it.Outside speakers not so good and loud.But with earphones headphones the quality is unmatched.Graphics are awesome.you can sit on this without any problems and eye strain.Maybe you need to buy external keyboard if you are into writing sort of thingsAnd also mouse as touchpad quality not so good.Does not have power on all ports of laptop.So i recommend it this is my honest review now its your choice.`

  This Laptop, Seriously is a beast ! If you are thinking for Asus or MSI then you are making a mistake of either heating problems or an overpriced machine. Just go for it and No doubt after an upgrade to 16gb ram, It will surely make you happy at every single point of work done on this laptop(Beast)Whether it is Powerful Gaming , Streaming , Video editing , Animation , etc.Don't think that if you'll take a 144Hz screen then that will increase skills , because if you want a 144Hz refresh rate then just move to i7 with 1660ti, or to Predator Helios 300 (RTX2060) Because those will give you enough FPS to meet with 144Hz screen .Want a Budget Gaming Laptop = Acer Nitro 5 is the result :')

   I am sharing my experience of ups and downs I had faced while buying this laptop. IT'S TOTALLY MY EXPERIENCE AND POINT OF VIEW. I'm not claiming anything.Firstly, I bought this laptop in October - Great Indian Sale . After using it for few days I had noticed that my camera was not working properly. I thought it was a software problem. But even after installing all the latest drivers of my system and latest windows update, the problem continued to exist. I was worried because in review sections I had read that many people were upset and saying that amazon service is poor and they are neither replacing nor giving refund.So, I directly called the customer support and a female employee picked up the call. Guys believe me, she was TOO POLITE AND READY TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM. I explained her about my problem and asked for REFUND. But she told me to try for REPLACEMENT and if I face ANY PROBLEM again, amazon will REFUND THE FULL AMOUNT. She gave me the assurance and then I agreed for replacement because this LAPTOP IS GREAT IN THIS PRICE RANGE.Within 1 week, the guy from Amazon came, took back my old laptop and instantly delivered me the new laptop. I was given time again for 10 days to check the laptop before claiming for refund. So, I thoroughly checked this laptop and now I am TOTALLY HAPPY with the deal. I have been using this laptop since 1 month and then I'm writing this review.PERFORMANCE:-1.  I have been playing GTA V in my laptop with ULTRA SETTINGS and it runs PERFECTLY.USAGE (approx.) :-CPU- 50-80%GPU- 80-90%  (depends on your game graphics settings)RAM- 75-90%FPS- 50+  (60+ fps for VERY HIGH graphics and for ULTRA settings, 45-55 fps)And believe me, the temperature of laptop rises maximum upto 80 degree celsius. If you put your fan in MAXIMUM SPEED through NITROSENSE software, the temperature stays around 70-75 degrees. The cooling system is very good.2.  I am also using UBUNTU OS using virtual machine software VMWARE.BUILD QUALITY - Awesome. The cutting edges, matte finish, and vibrant RGB keyboard gives laptop a very cool appearance.BATTERY- It's appreciably good. Because the GPU is used only when games or heavy softwares are running.SOUND - If you enable DTS:X ULTRA software and customize your equalizer properly, you can get pretty good volume and sound quality too.DISPLAY - as it is backlit led IPS panel, it is totally understood that it will have some screen bleed issue. So, not to worry. It is common. But if you face excess of it that you can see it while normally using your laptop, then you should go for replacement.Otherwise, QUALITY OF SCREEN is awesome. It has good amount of brightness, properly balanced color and the screen has modern matte finish. It gives you an awesome experience.So guys don't worry, sometimes you may receive a faulty product, but there's always a solution. No one should DEFAME any company quickly.I am totally satisfied with AMAZON CUSTOMER SUPPORT and with this ACER NITRO 5.

After I plugged in charge it was running smooth at 60fps .At high setting 60fps too.It took around 1:40(approx.)min for it to start to the game's home screen/lobby (Downloaded in HDD) .1.2 Valorant :It took around 30 sec to start to the lobby(Download in HDD).1.2.1 Charger not plugged in:I played it on both High and Medium setting. I was getting 30fps on high and 60fps at medium.1.2.2 Charge Plugged in:On high settings got 100-120 Fps. Medium around 140-150 . Low  140-160 fps2.Display :Played 8k and 4k video on YouTube, the quality was supper amazing .2.2 Screen bleeding:I found many people complaining about screen bleeding, but there was no such issue in my unit. Not even slightest . You can replace is you have such issue.3.Battery :Played valorant without charging. Battery drained from 99% to 40%in 1hr(approx.)Charging may take up to 4hr (from 0-100)4.Wifi 6Downloaded Fortnite(26gb approx.) , it was downloaded in around 20-30 minNote : My wifi speed/plan is 10MB/s.5. Thermals/ HeatingPlayed above 2 games for 1hr (Fan was at auto), the temperature was around 60-70°C (The temp. I'm telling is what was showing on Nitro sense. It wasn't even noticeable . I winters the temp.  are usually low.Fan at Max are noisy (Not a big problem though )6. Boot / StartingIt takes around 5 sec to start .7. Camera :Camera is poor. 8 Cinebench score1544 ptsAdditional Information :1.If you're starting the laptop for first time, properly plug it in , you will hear a beep sound.( I didn't properly push/plug in the charger. I got worried a little bit <U+0001F605>)2.Personal Advice :First plug in the charger in socket then in the laptop, then switch on the charge.(Same when removing the charger)It's said . it's good for your batter lifeSome time I directly remove the charger <U+0001F605>Sorry if I missed some thing or the review was too long  .(Didn't upload images as there was nothing important to show. )

  The laptop is value for money don't expect too much it's worth its cost if your on budget , it's awesome cuz my friends paid too much for same specifications best budget killerCons*It's super loud fans are irritating*It's speaker are not loud enough*You don't get 144 hz refresh rate* It heats up if you charge too much* Some what heavy (it's personal opinion)

  Working well for past 20 days. But has some minor cons which ruin a good product.Minor screen bleeding is seen.Screen should have been strengthened little more like Dell ones.Power Button should have been outside the Keyboard and key(Home, End, Delete, power) placement is one of the worst implementation.Volume levels can be increased by configuring a new preset through DTS X ultra app.No lag seen on minimal gaming - Laracroft Tomb Raider but does heat up a lot and putting out takes a while. Stay cool enough for regular tasks - yet the GPU side of things heat up mildly sometimes.

  The screen quality is very good, it's full HD.There is an RGB keyboard which is my fav, then the bezzels are also really less in this model as compared to 9th gen.Overall the performance is very good, I have played many games in this laptop in one month so far and it has never hanged. It's very smoothThe only thing I found not compelling is the battery life, it's battery drains pretty fast so I have to plug it into the charger almost all the time (especially while gaming) , but that doesn't seem much of a problem to me as I am always at a desk with a socket nearby.And I got it in big billion days at 60k, which is definitely worth the price.

  The laptop has everything provided the price range games are performing smoothly and no heating issues till nowLet me tell you the cons:-1.) Speakers are below average2.) Screen bleeding issues3.) Hinge feels very weak4.) Plug-in of charger to laptop is very weak sometimes it doesn't connect u have to connect 2-3 times till charging starts

   Perfect product in price range of 60k to 67k than any other product in that range. With 1650 Ti graphic card.Rbg is awesome<U+0001F525>.No other laptop having rbg varients settings like nitro 5. Speakers are not really good but it is gaming laptop so ignore that con.

  A good package overall but i think it underperforms alot. The i5 10gen with 1650ti did not provide me the expected frame rates which other laptops with same specs do. I don't know what's the issue that's keeping it from performing to its full potential. Not to forget there is a little bit of screen bleeding.

  Do not go for it. The keyboard stopped working just after 10 days. I checked online and saw that this so many users are facing this problem. Only solution seems to be the replacement of keyboard. After that also you are most likely to face the issue again and again.

  Really Disappointed....After nearly waiting for 2 months.....Acer launches its laptop at a price segment of Rs 83k???....Acer has now sincerely lost most of its customers ,as most of them now would opt for Asus Tuf a15....RIP Acer

  I got this product for 63k in offline store.1) The screen is very good according to me.2) The keyboard is smooth to use.3) Gaming performance is great, runs most games at 60+ fps in FHD and high settings. 100+ fps in valorant and csgo at max settings.4) The battery is good as compared to other gaming laptops. Max 2.5hr backup with ligh use. I have uploaded the battery report picture. Gaming laptops have very less battery less than 2 hrs mostly as the cpu and other components use high power. So battery is 2 hr for average use like zoom class and chrome.5) Finish of the laptop is smooth and glossy but it is a high fingerprint magnet. It Gets finger marks easily.6) ssd is super fast boots the windows in mere 4seconds and restarts withing 20-30seconds.7) webcam is very average quality.8) audio quality is great. Provides clear voice and audio while gaming with discord.9) thermals are great, stays around 90°C while gaming. Nitrosense works great.

  Very bad laptop. After some days use i dont know why its giving me low fps although everything is updated. Bluetooth adapter was not wlrking. Keyboard gave problem after 6months. As power key is in the keyboard, keyboard stopped working after 9months. Don't buy product whose power key is in the keyboard, you will regreat. I made a worst purchase. Customer survice is very bad. I thing its enaugh for you to not buy this product.

  Comfortably getting around 200 fps in csgo and valorant.. thermals are awesome using it for a week no issues noticed so far, good build quality despite being plastic, slightly heavy, missing 144hz screen, delivery was on time by Amazon and I exchanged my old laptop without much hassle

  The best laptop within 65k. I got this 2 days back and was absolutely best ever I have seen for gaming as well as High tasks. The one and only problem is the screen refreshment rate which is 60Hz which can be covered by it's performance. GOOD TO PURCHASE THIS LAPTOP!

  I decided to buy Asus tuf A 15 Ryzen hexa core but unfortunately it is out of stock. Instead of that I bought Acer nitro 5  and now I think I chosen the right one . Great thermal and performance. Really a good deal at Rs 62900
